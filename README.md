# Apple MusicStream – Challenge 2
Apple Music Home Page Deconstruction
## Overview:

For Challenge 2, I decided to look closely at Apple Music and try to recreate parts of its Home Page using SwiftUI.
My focus was to understand how the app is structured, how different sections behave, and how Apple uses animations, materials, spacing, and navigation.

This project is basically my attempt to rebuild the feel of Apple Music and learn as much as possible from the process.

## 🎯 Goal

### The main goals for this challenge were:


- Improve my SwiftUI skills

- Learn how to follow Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines

- Explore iOS 26 features (materials, blurs, transitions, etc.)

- Practice cleaner architecture and component-based design

- I wanted to get closer to the “why” behind Apple’s design choices and push myself to write cleaner, more structured SwiftUI code.


## 🛠️ What I Built

### During this challenge, I recreated several features inspired by Apple Music:

- Horizontal ScrollViews

- Music cards

- A liquid-glass style Tab Bar

- Navigation flows and modal views

- Simple but smooth animations

- Search / buttons and general layout structure

- Reusable UI components separated into SwiftUI files

- Most of the work focused on getting the Home Page interactions to feel natural and Apple-like.

## 🔧 Process
### 1️⃣ Deconstruction

I inspected the Apple Music Home Page and broke it into smaller pieces: hero banners, playlists, card animations(Collections), etc.

### 2️⃣ Roadmap

I planned which elements I wanted to recreate and in what order.

### 3️⃣ Research

I read Apple’s HIG, checked documentation, and paid attention to spacing, animations, and UI behavior in the real app.

### 4️⃣ Building the UI

I recreated everything step by step in SwiftUI and tried to keep the UI smooth and responsive.

### 5️⃣ CBL Steps

I followed the Challenge Based Learning method while working on the project.

### 6️⃣ Problem Solving

I faced issues with layouts, transitions, and navigation, but solved them using mentor feedback, documentation, and testing.

## 📚 What I Learned

This challenge helped me improve in several areas:

- SwiftUI fundamentals and advanced layout techniques

- Using materials, masks, and animations in iOS 26

- Following Apple’s design system and UI guidelines

- Writing cleaner, modular UI components

- Using GitHub more confidently

- Better research habits and debugging workflow

## ✅ Final Result

### The final result is a functional SwiftUI prototype inspired by the Apple Music Home Page.
It includes:

- Card animations

- Multiple scrollable sections

- Tab bar

- Navigation + modals

- Organized and readable code

- It’s not a full clone, but it recreates many of the key elements from the real app.

## ▶️ How to Run

1- Clone this repository

2- Open the project in Xcode

3- Run it on an iOS 26 simulator or a real device

## ✔️ Done

### This README reflects my process and the final result of Challenge 2.
